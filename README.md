# Super Store Analytics Project

## Introduction
This project analyses retail sales data spanning multiple branches and cities to uncover patterns in customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends. Using SQL, we aim to explore key metrics such as branch-wise sales, product line preferences, payment methods, and time-based patterns to derive actionable business insights.

## Objective
The objective is to evaluate branch and city performance, identify high-performing product lines, and understand customer preferences based on demographics, payment methods, and time of purchase. These insights will guide data-driven strategies to improve customer satisfaction, optimize product offerings, and maximize revenue.

## About Data
This project's data was obtained from the Kaggle Superstore Sales Forecasting Competition and it encompasses sales transactions from three branches situated in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw, respectively.

## Approach Used
***1.	Data Wrangling***

During this initial phase, the data is examined to detect any NULL or missing values, and strategies for data replacement are implemented to address and substitute these values effectively.
- Build a database
- Create a table and insert the data.
- Select columns with null values in them. Null values are not present in our database because, in creating the tables, NOT NULL was specified for each field, effectively filtering out any null values.

***2.	Feature Engineering***

This will help use generate some new columns from existing ones.
- Add a new column named time_of_day to give insight of sales in the Morning, Afternoon and Evening. This will help answer the question on which part of the day most sales are made.
- Add a new column named day_name that contains the extracted days of the week on which the given transaction took place (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri). This will help answer the question on which week of the day each branch is busiest.
- Add a new column named month_name that contains the extracted months of the year on which the given transaction took place (Jan, Feb, Mar). Help determine which month of the year has the most sales and profit.

***3.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)***

Conducting exploratory data analysis is essential to address the project's questions and objectives.
